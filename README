cirsiumNeuron is a neuronal circuit simulator that can directly and 
efficiently compute characterizations of stochastic behavior, i.e., 
noise, for multi-neuron circuits. It is still in its early stages of 
development, so beware of bugs!

cirsiumNeuron requires the SUNDIALS suite and the MATLAB interface of 
SUNDIALS called sundialsTB. In order to install SUNDIALS and sundialsTB, 
please download SUNDIALS (version 2.6.0), which is available 
at http://computation.llnl.gov/casc/sundials/main.html, and follow 
the installation instructions given at the above link. 
In order to install sundialsTB, within MATLAB, navigate to the sundialsTB 
subdirectory and run  the script called "install_STB.m". 
You will need a C compiler that is recognized by MATLAB in order to 
generate .mex files. The installed sundialsTB and the source code 
for cirsiumNeuron should be added to the MATLAB path before attempting 
to use cirsiumNeuron.

Please type "help circuit" in MATLAB for a brief tutorial on how to 
construct a simple circuit with cirsiumNeuron.

Please see the papers below for the details of the formulations and 
techniques implemented in cirsiumNeuron:
